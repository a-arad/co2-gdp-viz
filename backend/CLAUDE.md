This CLAUDE.md file provides detailed guidance for the development and maintenance of the backend components of the co2-gdp-viz project, which is implemented using Python with Flask. The backend is designed to handle data retrieval from the World Bank API, process environmental data (CO2 emissions and GDP per capita), and serve it to the frontend with appropriate CORS headers. Developers should begin by understanding the structure of the Flask application defined in app.py. This file should set up the Flask application instance, configure CORS using flask-cors, and define endpoints that the frontend will interact with. The module data_fetcher.py is responsible for retrieving data; therefore, it must leverage the World Bank API (via the wbgapi library) efficiently. Ensure that all API calls are wrapped in error handling routines and that rate limits or unexpected API issues are logged for further review. The file wbgapi_integration.py should contain reusable functions that abstract away the complexities of interfacing with the World Bank API, while config.py stores application-specific configurations such as API keys, endpoints, or other parameters. The use of pandas for data manipulation requires strict adherence to processing pipelines that are both transparent and reproducible. This includes clear comments explaining each data transformation step, using descriptive variable names, and avoiding chained operations that could obscure errors. Testing is critical here, with backend tests to be written in backend.test.py under the tests directory to verify API endpoints, data transformation functions, and error-handling routes. Furthermore, all code must adhere to PEP8 guidelines and utilize virtual environments for dependency isolation. Every change or new feature should be accompanied by unit tests that verify both happy-path and edge-case data scenarios. Agents must use logging to capture errors and data mismatches for easier debugging in production. Finally, consider security implications for API endpoints by sanitizing all inputs and ensuring that only necessary data is exposed to the frontend. This detailed guidance is designed to foster collaboration among AI agents and human developers alike, ensuring that backend modifications are maintainable, scalable, and integrated seamlessly with the rest of the project.
