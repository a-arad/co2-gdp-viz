This CLAUDE.md file provides all necessary guidance for developing and maintaining the frontend components of the co2-gdp-viz project. The frontend is built using vanilla JavaScript with D3.js for rendering data-driven visualizations and axios for making HTTP requests. All agents working in this area should follow best practices for modular JavaScript and maintain a clear separation between logic, presentation, and data handling. The index.html file initializes the webpage and includes clear structures that reference main.js and the styles.css file. The main.js file acts as the entry point for orchestrating visualization components and should import helper functions and modules from the components and utils directories. For D3.js, adhere to the idiomatic use of selections, joins, transitions, and data binding. Every component (such as AnimatedScatterPlot.js, CountryDropdown.js, and TimeControls.js) should encapsulate its functionality and expose clear public methods for updating visualizations dynamically. Code should be commented thoroughly, with an emphasis on explaining data joins and transformation logic. Additionally, API communication should leverage axios with proper error handling. All asynchronous calls require try/catch blocks to capture and report errors gracefully. The code should be structured such that each component is independent and testable. Agents must ensure that the styling adheres to a consistent theme by updating and referencing styles.css across components. The file structure should minimize merge conflicts by encouraging feature branches and pull requests for new changes. Testing for the frontend should be automated using appropriate testing frameworks, with tests located under the tests directory. Moreover, code reviews should focus on ensuring consistency in variable naming, function signatures, and modular architecture. Finally, agents working on this directory should adhere to semantically structured HTML and modern JavaScript practices, including the use of ES6 modules, arrow functions, and const/let declarations, ensuring the code base remains maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand by any developer joining the project.
